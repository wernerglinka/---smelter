# State Management Standardization - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Context Architecture ✅

We've established a standardized context architecture to solve several issues:

1. **Consistent error handling**
   - Created ErrorContext for centralized error handling
   - Standardized error reporting with type and context

2. **Form operations standardization**
   - Created FormOperationsContext to maintain uncontrolled form pattern while standardizing operations
   - Provided methods to work with form fields in a consistent way (getValue, setValue, etc.)

3. **Context organization**
   - Created central context directory
   - Standardized naming and implementation patterns
   - Created AppProviders component to wrap all providers

4. **Improved async support**
   - Created useAsyncOperation hook for standardized loading/error states
   - Updated submit-handler.js with better error handling
   - Added useFormSubmission hook to combine context with submission logic

5. **Error boundaries**
   - Added ErrorBoundary component to catch and display errors
   - Integrated with ErrorContext for unified error reporting

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Component Refactoring (In Progress)
✅ Refactored ArrayField to use the new context pattern
✅ Refactored ObjectField to use the new context pattern
- Update remaining field components to use FormOperationsContext
- Add ErrorBoundary to critical sections
- Implement loading states in components with async operations

#### Completed for ArrayField and ObjectField:
- Added proper error handling with ErrorContext
- Implemented loading indicator for async operations
- Enhanced validation state display
- Standardized form operations with FormOperationsContext 
- Improved logging with structured logger
- Added try/catch blocks for all operations
- Added visual feedback for errors and loading states
- Updated tests to support new context requirements

### Phase 3: Form Flow Improvement
- Standardize validation and feedback approach
- Implement consistent UI for form errors
- Update error display mechanism

### Phase 4: Documentation & Testing
- Improve test coverage for contexts
- Add examples to README files
- Document migration patterns for developers

## Testing Status
- All existing tests pass with the new context system
- Validation and form submission now use standardized patterns
- Additional test scenarios may be needed for new hooks

## Notes
- The implementation preserves the uncontrolled form pattern for performance
- Error handling is now more consistent with the logger and ErrorContext
- Async operations now have standardized loading states
